	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I'm most inspired by the two websites <a href="http://ubercontent.com/">Uber Content</a> and <a href="http://www.amazeelabs.com/en/">Amazee Labs</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p><em>Uber Content:</em> The circles with the directors' photographs are arranged into a balanced pattern, giving equal weight to each director. Similarly, the rectangles with videos of their work are arranged into a balanced pattern, giving equal weight to each video. This visual balance is effective because it communicates to the user that each object arranged in the pattern is of equal importance.<br><br><em>Amazee Labs:</em> The positive space and negative space interact with each other, blurring the line between content and background and making the web page more visually exciting to the viewer.
	</p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p><em>Uber Content</em> is very clean and organized while <em>Amazee Labs</em> has a lot more visual information and less organization. <em>Uber Content</em> arranges images into balanced patterns, which helps the user understand that each image deserves equal attention. <em>Amazee Labs</em> is visually interesting, with important words stylized into images and negative and positive spaces interacting with each other. Both websites effectively draw the user in with bold images and words. Additionally, the two websites make the user experience fun and interactive.

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home Page (Version 1)</strong></li><img src="Homepage1.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The large image in the center serves as the <strong> focal point </strong>because of its size in relation to the other elements on the page. The <strong> hierarchy </strong> is thus dominated by this image, followed by the text box directly underneath, and lastly the smaller text box at the bottom. Because the elements on the page are all aligned in the horizontal center, the visual <strong> balance </strong> is vertically symmetrical, with equal amounts of negative space to the right and left of the positive space.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home Page (Version 2)</strong></li><img src="Homepage2.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The large image on the left and the large text box on the right both serve as <strong>focal points </strong> because of their similar size in relation to each other. The <strong>hierarchy </strong> is thus equally dominated by image and text box, followed by the smaller text box directly underneath. The visual <strong> balance </strong> is neither vertically nor horizontally symmetrical.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>About (Version 1)</strong></li><img src="About1.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The large image on the left serves as the <strong> focal point </strong> because of it's size in relation to the other elements on the page. The <strong> hierarchy </strong> is thus dominated by this image, followed by the text box directly underneath, and lastly the smaller image centered underneath the text box. While the top of the text box aligns with the top of the large image and the bottom of the small image aligns with the bottom of the large image, the visual <strong> balance </strong> is not symmetrical. There is more positive space than there is negative space due to the scale of the objects.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>About (Version 2)</strong></li><img src="About2.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The large text box at the top center of the page serves as the <strong> focal point </strong> because of it's size in relation to the two slightly smaller images directly underneath. The <strong> hierarchy </strong> is thus dominated by this text box, followed by two images directly underneath, which are both exactly the same size and thus carry equal weight. The visual <strong> balance </strong> is vertically symmetrical, with equal amounts of negative space to the right and left of the positive space.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Commissions (Version 1)</strong></li><img src="Commissions1.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The five circles at the top of the page serve as the <strong> focal point </strong>because of their relative size as a whole to the text box underneath. Because all the circles are of equal size and arranged across the page in a balanced pattern, they each have equal weight. The <strong> hierarchy </strong> is thus dominated by this grouping of circles, followed by the text box directly underneath. The visual <strong> balance </strong>is vertically symmetrical, with equal amounts of negative space to the right and left of the positive space.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Commissions (Version 2)</strong></li><img src="Commissions2.jpg">
	</ul>
	<p>The three circles serve as the <strong> focal point </strong>because of their location in the center of the page. Because all the circles are of equal size and arranged across the center of the page in a vertical line, they each have equal weight. The <strong> hierarchy </strong> is thus dominated by this grouping of circles, followed by the two text boxes to the right and left. The visual <strong> balance </strong> is vertically and horizontally symmetrical, with equal amounts of negative space to the right and left of the positive space, as well as above and below.</p>
